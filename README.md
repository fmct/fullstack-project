# FullStack Products Project
Simple FullStack Products Project composed by an Rest API and a Single Web Page App. 

The backend Rest API is secured by using JWT and supports the basic CRUD operations for products:

 * Create a new product
 * Retrieve a list of all products
 * Retrieve a single product
 * Update a product
 * Delete a product
 
The Web application allows users to Login or Signup. And after this step (and only after) they can navigate trough the products section.

## Requirements
